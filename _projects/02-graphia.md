Existing complex networks share well known structural properties that can be captured by models: Erdos-Renyu, small-world, scale-free ...

However, these models only describe networks at a given time. The objective of this project was to study and implement models for dynamical networks. For this, I created a tool in Rust : [`graphia`](https://github.com/grodino/graphia/).

The report can be found [here](/assets/images/projects/graphia/IA_ML_Models_for_real_mobile_networks.pdf).
